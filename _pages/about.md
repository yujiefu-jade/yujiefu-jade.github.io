## About Me {#about}
I'm a third-year master's student from Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences / School of Basic Medicine Peking Union Medical College. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Yamei NIU and Prof. Wei-Ming Tong.
    
My research interests focus on: m6A modification, mitochondria and neurodegenerative diseases. 

I'm currently exploring PhD opportunities, so if you're interested in me, feel free to [email me](mailto:fyjjade5525@gmail.com).
